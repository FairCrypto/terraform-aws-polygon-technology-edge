# <center>Polygon Edge AWS Terraform</center>

Polygon Edge is a modular and extensible framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.

To find out more about Polygon, visit the [official website](https://polygon.technology/).

### Documentation üìù

If you'd like to learn more about the Polygon Edge, how it works and how you can use it for your project,
please check out the **[Polygon Edge Documentation](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/edge/overview/)**.

## Terraform deployment 

This is a fully automated Polygon Edge blockchain infrastructure deployment for AWS cloud provider.

High level overview of the resources that will be deployed:
* Dedicated VPC
* 4 validator nodes (which are also boot nodes)
* 4 NAT gateways to allow nodes outbound internet traffic
* Lambda function used for generating the first (`genesis`) block and starting the chain
* Dedicated security groups and IAM roles
* S3 bucket used for storing `genesis.json` file
* Application Load Balancer used for exposing the `JSON-RPC` endpoint

### Prerequisites

Three variables that must be provided, before running the deployment:

* `account_id` - the AWS account ID that the Polygon Edge blockchain cluster will be deployed on.
* `alb_ssl_certificate` - the ARN of the certificate from AWS Certificate Manager to be used by ALB for https protocol.   
  The certificate must be generated before starting the deployment, and it must have **Issued** status.
* `premine` - the account/s that will receive pre mined native currency.
  Value must follow the official [CLI](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/edge/get-started/cli-commands#genesis-flags) flag specification.

### Fault tolerance

Only regions that have 4 availability zones are required for this deployment. Each node is deployed in a single AZ. 

By placing each node in a single AZ, the whole blockchain cluster is fault-tolerant to a single node (AZ) failure, as Polygon Edge implements IBFT 
consensus which allows a single node to fail in a 4 validator node cluster.

### Command line access

Validator nodes are not exposed in any way to the public internet (JSON-PRC is accessed only via ALB) 
and they don't even have public IP addresses attached to them.  
Nodes command line access is possible only via ***AWS Systems Manager - Session Manager***. 

### Base AMI upgrade

This deployment uses `ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server` AWS AMI. It will **not** trigger EC2 *redeployment* if the AWS AMI gets updated.

If, for some reason, base AMI is required to get updated, 
it can be achieved by running `terraform taint` command for each instance, before `terraform apply`.   
Instances can be tainted by running the `terraform taint module.instances[<AZ>].aws_instance.polygon_edge_instance` command, 
where `<AZ>` is the availability zone
Example with default configuration:
```shell
terraform taint module.instances[\"us-west-2a\"].aws_instance.polygon_edge_instance
terraform taint module.instances[\"us-west-2b\"].aws_instance.polygon_edge_instance
terraform taint module.instances[\"us-west-2c\"].aws_instance.polygon_edge_instance
terraform taint module.instances[\"us-west-2d\"].aws_instance.polygon_edge_instance
terraform apply
```

### Deployment

VPC must be created beforehand, as the instances are deployed using a loop which must know all
AZ names in advance.

To do this, simply run `terraform apply -target=module.vpc` and then `terraform apply` after it.
